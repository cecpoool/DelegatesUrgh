# DelegatesUrgh - Delegate functions in C#
CSVHandler/FileParser using Delegate functions

This was an assessment for school on Delegate functions.

It was for intake of a File, creation of a CSV, insertion of the data in the CSV into an object(Person) and sort and search within class.

It was difficult. I managed to finish the file Parser, the CSV Handler but had major issues getting the data into the object.

I did create the main delegate function however.
